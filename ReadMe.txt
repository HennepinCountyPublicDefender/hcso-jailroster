This is a project that polls the Hennepin County Sherrif's Office for new bookings
=========================================

The idea then is to determine whether or not the person is a client of our office so that we can notify their attorney(s)

To build this project use

    mvn install

To deploy the example in OSGi. For example using Apache ServiceMix
or Apache Karaf. You will run the following command from its shell:

    osgi:install -s mvn:com.hennepin/hcso-jailroster
